### 1.iii. Cross kingdom courtesy

Our kingdom is part of the IKFPA alliance and respects the rules: no attacks on clan buildings, memorial portals, and players below 100K might, and no attack on resources tiles except during specific events.
Always stay up to date on ROE.

Remember: We respect the ROE. ALL OF US, you and me. Set a good example for your co-players and peacefully solve problems between players. All clans must be promoters of making ROE known to new players.

Each clan must:

include "We respect the ROE of K281" in its description, so that everyone can see them.

### 1.iv The Royal Guard & Executioners Task Force (hereinafter referred to as "TF"), Responsibilities:

Attacks official outlaws and collects resources for damage repayment per court orders.

Judgments owed to victims shall be transmitted to the TF by the courts.
Remits judgment payments to victims upon collection with resources above the judgment amount remain with the TF as payment for service.

### 2. TAXES

### 2.i. Tax payment purpose

The gold ingots are useless at the individual player level. 

They are used for kingdom-level projects, defences, bonuses, and to maintain the strength of the entire kingdom.

Everyone's contribution helps us stay competitive and safe.

To pay taxes: go to the city, go to the Capitol, select "pay taxes" and pay them all so you don't have any ingots left.

The ingots should be sent as soon as possible. 

Cities must respect the gold ingots limit based on their level.

All clan leaders are responsible for their clan paying taxes.


### 2.ii. Tax collection limits

To support the growth of the kingdom, taxes can be collected by tax collectors if cities exceed the following amount:

City of level 1-19: maximum 10,000 ingots 

City of level 20-34: maximum 40,000 ingots 

City of level 35+: maximum 60,000 ingots

Cities with more than 100,000 ingots are subject to immediate attacks by the Royal Guards approved by the Treasury.


### 3. RESOURCES

### 3.i. Resource ownership

Attacking a player on any general non-registrable resource tile is prohibited as detailed below.

Attacking any general resource tiles include iron, silver, stone, wood, etc. and all clan/player generated tiles or tournament chest including, but not limited to snowman, pumpkins, mimic chest, etc. is prohibited, with two exceptions:

an enemy player is occupying a general resource tile within your clan territory.

the tar wellspring or gold dragon mound has not been properly registered in the wild.

Note: the 50% might rule does not apply in these two cases.


### 3.ii. Wellspring & Dragon Mound Registration

All tar wellsprings & gold dragon mounds located in the wild must be registered by current occupant.

Ownership goes to the first registrant. No mining without holding registration.

Registration must be in dedicated chats, by sharing the tile coordinates of the resource or only the Y-coordinate, to prevent attacks from other kingdoms.

Players can only register 1 dragon mound & 1 wellspring each every 24-hours.

The registrant must reach the resource within 30 minutes. If interrupted, harvesting must resume immediately (Resource line - Clan), otherwise the claim is forfeited.

If problems arise, contact the registrant or the chat moderator.



### 3.iii. Causes for Gold Mounds/Tar Wellspring Mining & Registration Ban

Mining any tar wellspring or gold mounds without prior registration or written permission from official registrant = 48 hour ban from gold/tar mining, registration and chat

Comments other than coordinates or cancellations in registration chat = 48 hour ban from gold/tar mining, registration and chat



### 3.iv. Additional Resource Tile, Tar Wellspring, & Gold Mound Clarification 

No attack waiting time & no application of 50% might rule on:

Player-made owner resource tiles located anywhere - labelled with a grey banner

Clan territory resources - be careful as clan borders can change. In these cases ownership goes to registrant, so clans are encouraged to register for added safety.

Registered resource tiles - Attack reports from tiles showing under 25 units of resources gathered will be assumed to be a race between two players.

IV. ATTACKS REGULATION

Attacks and scouting during peacetime are prohibited, unless in the event of an agreed CP exchange.

Exceptions include:

Authorization of the King or Queen in case of emergency and tax collections

The target is a player or a clan officially declared Outlaw.

Retaliation must be based on a verifiable battle report in the game.

If the victim is unable to take revenge due to the loss of the army, a member of the clan can take revenge on their behalf.

A proof of the request to retaliate on their behalf must be provided (message).

The avenging clan member must provide a battle report.

Retaliation forfeits any right to dispute resolution or compensation on that individual incident.

VI.A. Resources compensation

Gold ingots are not subject to compensation.

The stolen resources (lumber, iron, stone, food and silver) must be fully compensated, as indicated on the attack report.

The taxes on caravan shipments are held by the sender.

Gold from dragon mounds or gold mines:

1,000 in gold = 1 million silver
Tar from wellspring: 1,000 of tar = 1
million silver

For a first offense, the attacker must create gold mines for the attacked player equal to the value of their Dragon Mound; failing to have enough blueprints incurs a penalty of 2.5 million silver for every 1,000 gold short.

If the attacker strikes again within two weeks, the penalty doubles. A third attack in that timeframe classifies the attacker as an outlaw, leading to expulsion from the kingdom.

### 4. ATTACKS REGULATION

### 4.i. Clan buildings

No attacks on clan buildings, memorial portals, and players below 100K might, and no attack on resources tiles except during specific events.

### 4.ii Conquest Points exchange

Attacks and scouting during peacetime are prohibited, unless in the event of an agreed CP exchange.

Exceptions include:

Authorization of the King or Queen in case of emergency and tax collections

The target is a player or a clan officially declared Outlaw.

Retaliation must be based on a verifiable battle report in the game.

If the victim is unable to take revenge due to the loss of the army, a member of the clan can take revenge on their behalf.

A proof of the request to retaliate on their behalf must be provided (message).

The avenging clan member must provide a battle report.

Retaliation forfeits any right to dispute resolution or compensation on that individual incident.

VI.B. Lost troops and damaged walls compensation

Lost troops and damaged walls must be compensated based on the might of the attacking player.

Below 1M might: 1M silver

Between 1M and 10M might: 2M silver

Above 10M might: 20% of the might in silver




VI.C. Clan responsibility

A clan is responsible for removing any clan member with an official outlaw status within a 24 hour period of court ruling.

The clan must provide the court and Executioners task force the last known location of newly classified outlaw directly following removal from clan.

When these requirements for removal of the outlawed player from the clan are met, the clan responsibility for outlawed player's previous actions will officially be considered nullified by the court.

A clan is responsible for the behavior of their members who have no official outlaw status.

If a player does not agree to pay a compensation, the clan is responsible to pay it.

The player can be expelled from their clan for not agreeing to send compensation.

The clan is free to attack the recently expelled player or nominate a champion to do so.

The champion must pay the compensation.
