### 1. GENERALITIES

### 1.i. Aims of the kingdom

This kingdom K281 will focus on bringing people together to work more closely to achieve growth goals and learn to collaborate. 

The goal is to improve teamwork and collaboration between K281 Clans.

It includes:

Achieve greater cooperation between clans.

Cultivate positive vibes and fun fair play.

Grow proactively.

Maintain a Royal Guard & Executioners Task Force, consisting of volunteers & mighty players, throughout the kingdom & develop a collaboration to defend it.

### 1.ii. Individual behavior

Treat others with respect.
Do not use hate speech, do not use racial/gender insults and do not provoke others to do so. This will be focused on more than ever and there will be no room for this type of behaviour and practice of this will lead to harsh consequences.

Particularly, the senate chat is strictly forbidden to be used as a dispute platform as it should only contain constructive discussions and collaboration activities.

As well as above listed, any sitting or elected Senator that violates the ROE  of K281 & is found guilty by the court will automatically lose their seat in the senate.


### 1.iii. Cross kingdom courtesy

Each clan must:

include "We respect the ROE of K281" in its description, so that everyone can see them or else not have the protection that ROE provides (safety for players under 100k remains)- this is to identify bot clans or non-compliant clans.

add their clan leader in the clan leaders' chat.

assign a diplomat to the diplomatic chat.


### 1.iv The Royal Guard & Executioners Task Force (hereinafter referred to as "TF"), Responsibilities:

Defends the kingdom from external attacks, including closing hostile portals.

Actively participates in Clash of Kingdoms event, aiming to achieve a higher rank through banner swaps, while housing amongst all interested non-outlawed players.

Aids in CP clan exchanges to mitigate internal kingdom attacks.
Collects excessive taxes within the kingdom.

Undertakes retaliation for players with might deficits, including on registered Gold Mounds & Tar Wellsprings when called in by player that holds resource registration.
Attacks official outlaws and collects resources for damage repayment per court orders.

Judgments owed to victims shall be transmitted to the TF by the courts.
Remits judgment payments to victims upon collection with resources above the judgment amount remain with the TF as payment for service.

### 2. TAXES

### 2.i. Tax payment purpose

The gold ingots are useless at the individual player level. 

They are used for kingdom-level projects, defences, bonuses, and to maintain the strength of the entire kingdom.

Everyone's contribution helps us stay competitive and safe.

To pay taxes: go to the city, go to the Capitol, select "pay taxes" and pay them all so you don't have any ingots left.

The ingots should be sent as soon as possible. 

Cities must respect the gold ingots limit based on their level.

All clan leaders are responsible for their clan paying taxes.


### 2.ii. Tax collection limits

To support the growth of the kingdom, taxes can be collected by tax collectors if cities exceed the following amount:

City of level 1-19: maximum 10,000 ingots 

City of level 20-34: maximum 40,000 ingots 

City of level 35+: maximum 60,000 ingots

Cities with more than 100,000 ingots are subject to immediate attacks by the Royal Guards approved by the Treasury.


### 3. RESOURCES

### 3.i. Resource ownership

The following resources are not subjected to registration:

general resource tiles located within a clan area belong to the clan including lumber, iron, stone, food, and silver (be cognizant of clan territory lines shifting as any non-registrable rss within clan lines belongs to the clan)

Player created resources, chests, or mines of any kind

Game generated, non-registrable tiles located in the wild can be mined if unoccupied 

Note: This ownership does not include monsters, crypts or citadels.


Attacking a player on any general non-registrable resource tile is prohibited as detailed below.

Attacking any general resource tiles include iron, silver, stone, wood, etc. and all clan/player generated tiles or tournament chest including, but not limited to snowman, pumpkins, mimic chest, etc. is prohibited, with two exceptions:

an enemy player is occupying a general resource tile within your clan territory.

the tar wellspring or gold dragon mound has not been properly registered in the wild.

Note: the 50% might rule does not apply in these two cases.


### 3.ii. Wellspring & Dragon Mound Registration

Registration

All tar wellsprings & gold dragon mounds located in the wild must be registered by current occupant.
Ownership goes to the first registrant. No mining without holding registration.

Registration must be in dedicated chats, by sharing ONLY the Y-coordinate, to prevent attacks from other kingdoms.

Players can only register 1 dragon mound & 1 wellspring each every 24-hours.

The registrant must reach the resource within 30 minutes. If interrupted, harvesting must resume immediately (Resource line - CITY), otherwise the claim is forfeited.

If problems arise, contact the registrant or the chat moderator.


### 3.iii. Causes for Gold Mounds/Tar Wellspring Mining & Registration Ban

Mining any tar wellspring or gold mounds without prior registration or written permission from official registrant = 48 hour ban from gold/tar mining, registration and chat

Comments other than coordinates or cancellations in registration chat = 48 hour ban from gold/tar mining, registration and chat



### 3.iv. Additional Resource Tile, Tar Wellspring, & Gold Mound Clarification 

No attack waiting time & no application of 50% might rule on:

Player-made owner resource tiles located anywhere - labelled with a grey banner

Clan territory resources - be careful as clan borders can change. In these cases ownership goes to registrant, so clans are encouraged to register for added safety.

Registered resource tiles - Attack reports from tiles showing under 25 units of resources gathered will be assumed to be a race between two players.

IV. ATTACKS REGULATION

Attacks and scouting during peacetime are prohibited, unless in the event of an agreed CP exchange.

Exceptions include:

Authorization of the King or Queen in case of emergency and tax collections

The target is a player or a clan officially declared Outlaw.

Retaliation must be based on a verifiable battle report in the game.

If the victim is unable to take revenge due to the loss of the army, a member of the clan can take revenge on their behalf.

A proof of the request to retaliate on their behalf must be provided (message).

The avenging clan member must provide a battle report.

Retaliation forfeits any right to dispute resolution or compensation on that individual incident.

VI.A. Resources compensation

Gold ingots are not subject to compensation.

The stolen resources (lumber, iron, stone, food and silver) must be fully compensated, as indicated on the attack report.

The taxes on caravan shipments are held by the sender.

Gold from dragon mounds or gold mines:

1,000 in gold = 1 million silver
Tar from wellspring: 1,000 of tar = 1
million silver

For a first offense, the attacker must create gold mines for the attacked player equal to the value of their Dragon Mound; failing to have enough blueprints incurs a penalty of 2.5 million silver for every 1,000 gold short.

If the attacker strikes again within two weeks, the penalty doubles. A third attack in that timeframe classifies the attacker as an outlaw, leading to expulsion from the kingdom.

### 3.v. REGULATIONS FOR MODERATORS OF K281 GOLD & TAR CHATS

Moderators are King appointed & have executive authority in chats. Their decisions must be followed immediately & can be reviewed by the Kingdom's Courts.

Moderators must:
Enforce zero tolerance for disorder.

Act immediately to correct issues & disputes to maintain stability.
Ensure adherence to the ROE & document violations.

Issue warnings & silences; suspend repeat offenders for 1-7 days. Serious cases will involve the court.

Clash of the Throne (COT) is a three-day event. The first two days are the only PvP days in K281, while day three is for voting only and is not PvP as senators have been established.

Rules:
50% Might Rule- Players may only attack others with at least 50% of their might (e.g., a 500k might player may attack players above 250k). This protects lower-might players and encourages stronger players to seek targets in other kingdoms.

Players below 100k might cannot be attacked.

Attack Limit: A maximum of 5 consecutive attacks on the same player per day is allowed during COT; a 6th attack is illegal.

Any player may retaliate in a 1:1 ratio to an attack, preventing repeated attacks by lower-might players.

***outside of a 10% might difference may be considered to allow for might fluctuations only

### 4.v. Restriction on heroes

All attack-related activities are not limited in any way based on which hero you have equipped.

The use of Faron is forbidden unless the entire kingdom agrees to use it for protection against outsiders with bad intentions.

An exception can be made if you can prove that you did not cast a vote when you changed Faron to another hero before the vote.


### 5. PORTALS

Only the portal's owner can manage their portals & is fully responsible for their use, including event portals.

Monitor your portals & notify clanmates if they are used for attacks during PvP events.

4 types of portals:

Normal portal: allowed to be attacked only during PvP events, & following the 50% might rule.If a normal portal is used by any clan member to attack anything for any purpose including but not limited to a city, resource, chest, etc it instantly becomes classified as a hostile portal.

Event portal: used in an event (eg. epic monsters), & revert to normal status after the event is done. Attacking event portals is forbidden unless they are proven hostile with an attack report.

Hostile Portal: Any portal used to attack a member of your clan or resource. These may be attacked regardless of the might.

Memorial portal: A portal placed somewhere next to a clan, to remember a member who lef

The taxes on caravan shipments are held by the sender.

Gold from dragon mounds or gold mines:

1,000 in gold = 1 million silver
Tar from wellspring: 1,000 of tar = 1
million silver

The clan must provide the court and Executioners task force the last known location of newly classified outlaw directly following removal from clan.

When these requirements for removal of the outlawed player from the clan are met, the clan responsibility for outlawed player's previous actions will officially be considered nullified by the court.

A clan is responsible for the behavior of their members who have no official outlaw status.

If a player does not agree to pay a compensation, the clan is responsible to pay it.

The player can be expelled from their clan for not agreeing to send compensation.

The clan is free to attack the recently expelled player or nominate a champion to do so.

The champion must pay the compensation.

### 7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS

### 7.i. Use diplomacy

Following a dispute, proper procedure is:

Determine the attack is illegal using the chat K281 ROE+ 

Message your attacker and their clan leader. Include attack reports.

If after 24 hours no response is given, copy your attack report to your clan leader or diplomat and ask for assistance.

If needed, after clan level review, seek diplomatic assistance by posting in the chat: K281 VIOLATIONS

Follow the advice of the court and violations moderators within that chat.

Due to varying time zones, generally allow 24 hours for an initial response.

****If the attack is not resolved within a reasonable amount of time, your case may be elevated to the court, but please do not post attacks or write in the court chat without court permission as that is for rulings as opposed to discussions

### 7.ii. Request a hearing

If diplomacy fails, consider requesting a court hearing:

K281 COURT

Post there a brief summary naming both parties. Note that cases older than 3 days may not be accepted, unless reopened by the King, Queen, or Hand.

If accepted, a judge will open a private hearing chat and invite the diplomat of both parties. The judge will review any evidence (attack reports and time stamped posts) and will listen to the explanations of each side. After consideration and possible consultation with other judges, a ruling will proceed.

Severe penalties, such as the outlaw status, require agreement of two judges or the King. Appeals to a ruling can be made to the Legate, then the Queen or Hand of the King, then King. In urgent cases, the Royal Guard may be deployed, and the King, Queen, or Hand will issue a direct sentence.

### 8. OUTLAW STATUS
